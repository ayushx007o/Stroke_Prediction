# Stroke_Prediction

Objective: To predict Stroke of a person using Machine Learning

Project Outlines
- Discussed some major columns on which Stroke depends.
- Handling outliers of diagnosis columns. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting strokes.
- Then I used different classification models present in sklearn to train the model.
- Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

MODELS USED

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
K Nearest Neighbour
Random Forest Classifier
